## Improving Supply Performance at Thrifty.

### Introduction:

Thrifty, a marketplace for thrift apparel, faced a few challenges in their supply performance function and required  structural developments to help them regulate vendor performance. This project revolves around creation of a financial rewards and penalty structure for vendors focusing on certain KPIs to regulate their performance. The case study also dives deep into a root-cause analysis of an increase in product uploads but decrease in generated revenue, and how it can be resolved.

### Problem Statement:

#### Problem 1.

Since the beginning, Thrifty’s revenue has increased as the total product uploads increased. However, recently,
we had 2 months where even though the total products uploaded on the platform increased, the revenue
generated actually decreased.<br><br>
● Why do you think this could be happening?<br>
● Propose a way to confirm your theory and deduce if this is something that can be solved for. If so, what
would be a possible solution?

#### Problem 2.

We can assume that customer experience is determined by fulfillment time and quality of the products received
by the customer. When the team optimizes for speed, they tend to lose on quality. At times where both are not
correlated, it is often very difficult to optimize for speed for some vendors than others depending on their
regions etc.<br><br>
● Conceptually, Thrifty wants to introduce financial rewards and penalties to create structural
incentives/disincentives for certain desired or undesired behaviors. What specific KPIs (Key
Performance Indicators) should our rewards and penalty systems focus on?<br>
● Should these targets be the same across all vendors/sellers? Why?<br>
● Propose an incentive program for sellers to incentivise/disincentive certain behaviors with targets based
on data available.
