Hi there! My name is Abdullah, and I have transitioned from a non-tech background to data analytics. I plan to get proficient in using SQL, and this repository is particularly for that! I will be doing projects from time-to-time and uploading them here. Join me in this self-learning journey! I can be reached out via my LinkedIn handle attached in my profile.
