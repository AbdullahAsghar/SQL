# SQL Projects

This repository contains all projects I have completed using SQL.<br>
<br>
Each project is categorized under its own sub_folder, with ideally three resources.<br>
a. **README.md** (*an introduction of the project*) <br>
b. **Datasets.** (*used for analysis*) <br>
c. **SQL Script** (*this can be a singular file or multiple, depending on the length of queries written*)<br>
<br>
**(Projects ordered from latest to oldest.)**
<br>

| [Braintree SQL Coding Challenge](https://github.com/AbdullahAsghar/SQL_Portfolio/tree/main/Braintree_SQL_Coding_Challenge) | Inspired from [Alexander Connelly's](https://github.com/AlexanderConnelly/BrainTree_SQL_Coding_Challenge_Data_Analyst) attempt, I answered the questions of the coding challenge using my expertise in SQL. Datasets provided were related to the continents, countries, and their per capita GDP from 2004-2012. No particular problem statement but rather a test to examine SQL proficiency. | [Github](https://github.com/AlexanderConnelly/BrainTree_SQL_Coding_Challenge_Data_Analyst)  |   Complex Queries,<br>Advanced Aggregations & Comparisons,<br>Multiple Joins,<br>Data Validation & Error Detection<br> | Aggregaions,<br> Running Total,<br> YoY Comparisons<br> |
| [Airline Loyalty Program Analysis](https://github.com/AbdullahAsghar/SQL_Portfolio/tree/main/Braintree_SQL_Coding_Challenge) | In an effort to improve program enrollment, NLA (a fictitious airline) ran a promotion between Feb - Apr 2018. Dataset includes loyalty program signups, enrollment and cancellation details, and additional customer information. <br> **Problem Statement:** Impact of loyalty program on memberships, campiagn impact on booked flights, success of campaign adoption. | [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground) | Data Manipulation, <br> Aggregations, <br> Joins, <br> Window Functions, <br> CASE statements |Exploratory Data Analysis, <br>Revenue Analysis, <br>Performance Metrics Calculation, <br>Trends Identification, <br>Customer Segmentation <br>.|
| [The Wine Store - Inventory Analysis](https://github.com/AbdullahAsghar/SQL_Portfolio/tree/main/TWS_Inventory_Analysis) | TWS (The Wine Store - a fictitious wine manufacturer) requires a holistic analysis of its inventory for the year 2016. Dataset includes 6 tables, including the begginning and eding inventory records, purchase, and sales invoice records. <br> **Problem Statement:** Determining sales performance, inventory levels, identifying sales patterns (if any). | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/inventory-analysis-case-study?select=BegInvFINAL12312016.csv) | Data Manipulation, <br> Aggregations, <br> Joins, <br> Window Functions, <br> CASE statements <br> Coditional Logics | Sales Performance, <br>Inventory Turnover, <br> Price Elasticity, <br> Sales Contribution, <br> Geographical Sales Patterns,<br> Statistical Analysis.
