| Braintree SQL Coding Challenge | Inspired from [Alexander Connelly's](https://github.com/AlexanderConnelly/BrainTree_SQL_Coding_Challenge_Data_Analyst) attempt, I answered the questions of the coding challenge using my expertise in SQL. Datasets provided were related to the continents, countries, and their per capita GDP from 2004-2012. No particular problem statement but rather a test to examine SQL proficiency. | [Github](https://github.com/AlexanderConnelly/BrainTree_SQL_Coding_Challenge_Data_Analyst)  |   Complex Queries,<br>Advanced Aggregations & Comparisons,<br>Multiple Joins,<br>Data Validation & Error Detection<br>
